{"title":"Preface","markdown":{"headingText":"Preface","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"\nThree years ago, I wrote a book with a straightforward premise: by borrowing a\nfew key ideas from software engineering, people who analyse data could save\nthemselves a great deal of frustration. The response to that book was more\npositive than I could have ever hoped for, and it confirmed a suspicion I had:\nwe, as a community, are hungry for better ways to work.\n\nThat book, however, focused exclusively on the R ecosystem. A recurring question\nI received was, \"This is great, but what about Python?\" It was a fair question.\nThe world of data science is not a monologue; it’s a conversation between\nlanguages. So, I began what felt like the logical next step: writing a Python\nedition.\n\nI mapped out the chapters and identified the equivalent tools, `pipenv` for\ndependency management, `ploomber` for pipelines, and started writing. But as I\nwent deeper, a nagging feeling grew. I was solving the same problems all over\nagain, just with a different set of tools. This feeling was compounded by the\nrapid churn within the Python ecosystem itself. How many package managers have\nbeen created to solve virtual environment management? As of writing, `uv` is all\nthe rage, and while it may be here to stay, history suggests a new contender is\nalways just around the corner.\n\nThis pointed to a larger issue. I am convinced that the future of data science\nis polyglot. An R user and a Python user, both following my original advice,\nwould end up with reproducible projects, but their workflows would be\nfundamentally incompatible. They couldn't easily share an environment or build a\nsingle pipeline that leverages the strengths of both languages. While companies\nlike Posit have made excellent progress in making it easier to call Python from\nR, setting up a truly integrated development environment remains a challenge.\nAnd what if you wish to bring Julia, the other language of data analysis, into\nthe fold? It is not as popular as Python or R, but it has its own distinct\nappeal and advantages.\n\nI realised I was treating the symptoms, not the disease. The root problem wasn't\n\"How do I make R reproducible?\" or \"How do I make Python reproducible?\". The\nreal challenge was the lack of a universal foundation that could handle *any*\nlanguage, *any* tool, and *any* system dependency with absolute, bit-for-bit\nprecision.\n\nThat’s when I stopped writing the Python book.\n\nThe solution wasn't to create another language-specific guide but to find a tool\nthat operated at a more fundamental level. That tool, I am now convinced, is\n**Nix**.\n\nNix is not just another package manager; it is a powerful, declarative system\nfor building and managing software environments. It allows us to define the\n*entire* computational environment—from the operating system libraries up to the\nspecific versions of our R and Python packages—in a single, simple text file.\nWhen you use Nix, the phrase \"it works on my machine\" becomes obsolete. It is\nreplaced by the guarantee: \"it builds identically, everywhere, every time\"—with\na few caveats that we will explore, of course.\n\nThis book is the result of that realisation. It is a complete reimagining of the\noriginal. We are moving away from language-specific patchworks and toward a\nunified, polyglot workflow. We will use Nix as our bedrock, with the `{rix}` and\n`{rixpress}` R packages serving as our friendly interface to its power. You will\nlearn to build pipelines where R, Python, and Julia aren't just neighbours; they\nare collaborators, working together in a single, perfectly reproducible\nenvironment.\n\nA note for Python-first users: do not be deterred by the fact that `{rix}` and\n`{rixpress}` are R packages. You will be able to use them to define your\nenvironments (even integrating tools like `uv`) and orchestrate your pipelines,\nwhile doing all of your analytical work exclusively in Python. In this workflow,\nR simply becomes a convenient configuration language.\n\nThe core message from three years ago remains unchanged. You, as someone who\nwrites code to analyse data, are a developer. Your work is important, and it\ndeserves to be reliable. This book aims to give you the tools and the mindset to\nachieve that. The journey is more ambitious this time, but the payoff is far\ngreater.\n\nI hope you’ll join me.\n\nYou can read this book for free online at **[YOUR BOOK'S URL HERE]**.\n\nYou can submit issues,
