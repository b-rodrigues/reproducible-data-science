{"title":"Welcome!","markdown":{"headingText":"Welcome!","headingAttr":{"id":"","classes":["unnumbered"],"keyvalue":[]},"containsRefs":false,"markdown":"## A modern, unified, and language-agnostic workflow for data science using Nix.\n\n*This book is a complete reimagining of my previous work, \"Building Reproducible\nAnalytical Pipelines.\" If you're looking for the R-specific version of that\nbook, you can find it [here](https://www.raps-with-r.dev). But if you're ready\nfor the next step, you're in the right place.*\n\n::: {.content-hidden when-format=\"pdf\"}\n<figure>\n  <a href = \"https://leanpub.com/raps-with-python\">  \n    <img style=\"float: right; clear: right\" height=\"200\" src=\"https://d2sofvawe08yqg.cloudfront.net/raps-with-r/s_hero2x?1676902653\" alt=\"You can buy a copy on Leanpub.\"></img>\n</a>\n</figure>\n:::\n\nData scientists, statisticians, analysts, researchers, and many other\nprofessionals write a lot of code.\n\nNot only do they write a lot of code, but they must also read and review a lot\nof code as well. They either work in teams and need to review each other’s code,\nor need to be able to reproduce results from past projects, be it for peer\nreview or auditing purposes. And yet, they never, or very rarely, get taught the\ntools and techniques that would make the process of writing, collaborating,\nreviewing and reproducing projects possible.\n\nWhich is truly unfortunate because software engineers face the same challenges\nand solved them decades ago.\n\nThe aim of this book is to teach you how to use some of the best practices from\nsoftware engineering and DevOps to make your projects robust, reliable and\nreproducible. It doesn’t matter if you work alone, in a small or in a big team.\nIt doesn’t matter if your work gets (peer-)reviewed or audited: the techniques\npresented in this book will make your projects more reliable and save you a lot\nof frustration!\n\nAs someone whose primary job is analysing data, you might think that you are not\na developer. It seems as if developers are these genius types that write\nextremely high-quality code and create these super useful packages. The truth is\nthat you are a developer as well. It’s just that your focus is on writing code\nfor your purposes to get your analyses going instead of writing code for others.\nOr at least, that’s what you think. Because in others, your team-mates are\nincluded. Reviewers and auditors are included. Any people that will read your\ncode are included, and there will be people that will read your code. At the\nvery least future you will read your code. By learning how to set up projects\nand write code in a way that future you will understand and not want to murder\nyou, you will actually work towards improving the quality of your work,\nnaturally.\n\nThe book can be read for free on\n[https://b-rodrigues.github.io/reproducible-data-science/](https://b-rodrigues.github.io/reproducible-data-science/)\nand you'll be able buy a DRM-free Epub or PDF on\n[Leanpub](https://leanpub.com/)^[https://leanpub.com/] once there's more\ncontent.\n\nThis book is the culmination of my previous works. I started by writing a book\nfocused on R, and then began working on a Python edition. During that process, I\nhad a realization: tackling reproducibility one language at a time was solving\nthe symptoms, not the root cause. The real solution needed to be universal,\npowerful, and capable of handling any language or tool we might need.\n\n**That universal solution is Nix.**\n\nThis book moves beyond language-specific tooling. It presents a holistic\nworkflow where R, Python, and Julia are not competitors, but collaborators in a\nsingle, cohesive, and perfectly reproducible environment. We will cover:\n\n-   The Nix Philosophy: Why Nix is the ultimate tool for solving the \"it\n    works on my machine\" problem, once and for all.\n-   Declarative Environments with `{rix}`: How to use a simple R interface\n    to define exact, bit-for-bit reproducible software environments that include\n    specific versions of R, Python, Julia, their packages, and any system-level\n    dependencies.\n-   Polyglot Pipelines with `{rixpress}`: How to orchestrate complex\n    analytical pipelines that seamlessly pass data between different languages,\n    all managed by the Nix build system.\n-   Unit Testing and Functional Programming: Core principles for writing\n    robust, testable, and maintainable code, no matter the language.\n-   Distribution and Automation: How to package your entire reproducible\n    pipeline into a Docker container for easy sharing and automate your workflow\n    with GitHub Actions.\n\nWhile this is not a book for beginners (you should be familiar with at least one\ndata-centric programming language before reading this), I will not assume that\nyou have any knowledge of the tools discussed. But be warned, this book will\nrequire you to take the time to read it, and then type on your computer. Type *a\nlot*.\n\nI hope that you will enjoy reading this book and applying the ideas in your\nday-to-day, ideas which hopefully should improve the reliability, traceability\nand reproducibility of your code.\n\nIf you find this book useful, don’t hesitate to let me know!
