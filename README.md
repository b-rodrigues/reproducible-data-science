# Reproducible Polyglot Data Science: A Unified Approach with Nix

This repository contains the source code for my free ebook,
**Reproducible Polyglot Data Science**.
This book presents a modern, unified, and language-agnostic workflow
for creating analytical pipelines that are truly reproducible, from environment
to execution.

## What This Book Is About

This book is the culmination of my previous works and experiences, including:

-   [Reproducible Analytical Pipelines with R](https://raps-with-r.dev)
-   The `{rix}` R package for managing Nix environments
-   The `{rixpress}` R package for orchestrating Nix-based pipelines

After writing my first book and starting on a Python edition, I realized that
solving the reproducibility problem one language at a time was a flawed
approach. The real solution needed to be universal. That universal solution is Nix.

This book moves beyond language-specific tools. Instead, it shares a vision for
what robust, polyglot data science should be, with Nix as the foundational layer
that makes it all possible.

## What You'll Learn

-   **Master the Nix Philosophy:** Understand why Nix is the ultimate tool for
    solving the "it works on my machine" problem once and for all.
-   **Build Bulletproof Environments:** Use `{rix}` to declaratively define
    exact software environments, pinning versions of R, Python, Julia, their
    packages, and all system dependencies.
-   **Orchestrate Polyglot Pipelines:** Use `{rixpress}` to build, run, and
    debug complex analytical pipelines that seamlessly pass data between
    different languages.
-   **Automate and Distribute:** Package your pipelines with Docker and automate
    your entire workflow with GitHub Actions, all built on your reproducible Nix
    foundation.

## Read The Book

The latest compiled version of the book is available to read online here:

*(Note: The book is a work in progress, and the online version is updated periodically as new chapters are completed.)*

### Status (as of September 2025)

The book is actively being written. I expect it to be done by mid 2027.
