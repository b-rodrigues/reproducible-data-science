## Introduction

We are almost at the end of our journey. In the previous chapters, we built
reproducible environments with Nix, organised our code into pure functions,
added robustness with monads, proved correctness with unit tests, managed our
collaboration with Git, and bundled everything into shareable packages. We can
now run our pipelines in a 100% reproducible way.

However, all of this still requires manual steps. And maybe that's not a
problem; if your environment is set up and users only need to drop into a Nix
shell and run the pipeline, that's already a huge improvement. But you should
keep in mind that manual steps don't scale. Imagine you are part of a team that
needs to quickly ship products to clients. Several people contribute to the
product, and you might need to work on multiple projects in the same day. You
and your teammates should be focusing on writing code, not on repetitive tasks
like building images or running tests. Ideally, we would want to automate these
steps. That is what we are going to learn in this chapter.

This chapter will introduce you to the basic ideas of CI/CD (Continuous
Integration and Continuous Deployment) and DevOps with GitHub Actions. You will
learn how to set up workflows that automatically run your tests when you push
code, how to build Docker images and recover artifacts, and how to run your
pipelines directly from GitHub's servers. Because we're using Git to trigger all
the events and automate the whole pipeline, this approach is sometimes called
GitOps. The bottom line is that DevOps makes it easy for developers to focus on
coding and makes it easy for them to ship data products. By the end of this
chapter, you will have enough knowledge of GitHub Actions to automate your
Reproducible Analytical Pipeline in the cloud.

## Getting your repo ready for Github Actions

Obviously, you should use a project that is versioned on GitHub. Use the 
package we’ve developed previously. If you go on its GitHub page, 
you should see an "Actions" tab on top:

<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/ga_1.png")
```
</div>

This will open a new view where you can select a lot of available, ready to use
actions. "Actions" are premade scripts that execute some commands you might need:
such as setting up R, Python, running tests, etc. Since we’re using Nix, we don’t 
really need to look for any actions to set up our environments. However, we might
want to use some pre-made actions to upload artifacts for instance.

To actually configure our repository to run actions, we need to edit a file in our
project under the `.github/workflows` directory (create them if needed). 
In it, write a `yaml` file called `hello.yaml` and write the following in it:

```yaml
name: Hello world
on: [push]
jobs:
  say-hello:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - run: echo "Hello from Github Actions!"
      - run: echo "This command is running from an Ubuntu VM each time you push."
```

Let's study this workflow definition line by line:

```
name: Hello world
```

Simply gives a name to the workflow.

```
on: [push]
```

When should this workflow be triggered? Here, whenever something gets pushed.

```
jobs:
```

What is the actual things that should happen? This defines a list of actions.

```
  say-hello:
```

This defines the `say-hello` job.

```
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
```

This job should run on an Ubuntu VM. You can also run jobs on Windows or macOS
VMs, but this uses more compute minutes than a Linux VM (which doesn’t matter
for public projects. For private projects, the amount of compute minutes
is limited).

```
    steps:
```

What are the different steps of the job?

```
      - run: echo "Hello from Github Actions!"
```

First, run the command `echo "Hello from Github Actions!"`. This commands runs
inside the VM. Then, run this next command:

```
      - run: echo "This command is running from an Ubuntu VM each time you push."
```

Let's push, and see what happens on github.com:


<div style="text-align:center;">
  <video width="640" height="480" controls>
    <source src="images/ga_1.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>

If we take a look at the commit we just pushed, we see this yellow dot next to
the commit name. This means that an action is running. We can then take a look
at the output of the job, and see that our commands, defined with the `run`
statements in the workflow file, succeeded and echoed what we asked them.

## Nix and GitHub Actions

To set up Nix on GitHub Actions you can use several steps (create a new file
called `run-tests.yaml`):

```yaml
- name: Install Nix
  uses: cachix/install-nix-action@v31
  with:
    nix_path: nixpkgs=https://github.com/rstats-on-nix/nixpkgs/archive/r-daily.tar.gz

- name: Setup Cachix
  uses: cachix/cachix-action@v15
  with:
    name: rstats-on-nix
```

If you’re repository contains a `default.nix` file, the same environment you’ve been using
locally can be used on GitHub Actions just as easily. You can also instead
generate the `default.nix` from the `gen-env.R` script:

```yaml
- name: Build dev env
  run: |
    nix-shell --expr "$(curl -sl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/rix/main/inst/extdata/default.nix)" --run "Rscript -e 'source(\"gen-env.R\")'"
```

You can then use the shell to run whatever you need. For example, if you’re 
developing a package, you could run unit tests on each push:

```yaml
- name: devtools::test() via nix-shell
  run: nix-shell --run "Rscript -e \"devtools::test(stop_on_failure = TRUE)\""
```

`stop_on_failure = TRUE` is needed to make the step fail if there’s an error,
otherwise, the step would run successfully, even with failing tests.

Of course, if you’re developing a Python package, use `nix-shell --run "pytest"` instead to run the tests.

I highly recommend you run tests when pull requests get opened:

```yaml
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]
```

This will ensure that if someone contributes to your project, you know immediately if 
what they did breaks tests or not. If it does, ask them to fix the code until tests
pass.

## Running a dockerized workflow

This next example can be found in [this
repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/dockerized_pipeline_demo). This
example doesn't use Nix, `{rix}` nor `{rixpress}`, but the point here is to show
how a Docker container can be executed on GitHub Actions, and artifacts can be
recovered. The process is always the same, regardless is inside the Docker image.

This is what our workflow file looks like:

```yaml
name: Reproducible pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:

  build:

    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v5
    - name: Build the Docker image
      run: docker build -t my-image-name .
    - name: Docker Run Action
      run: docker run --rm --name my_pipeline_container -v /github/workspace/fig/:/home/graphs/:rw my-image-name
    - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
      with:
        name: my-figures
        path: /github/workspace/fig/

```

For now, let's focus on the `run` statements, because these should be familiar:

```
run: docker build -t my-image-name .
```

and:

```
run: docker run --rm --name my_pipeline_container -v /github/workspace/fig/:/home/graphs/:rw my-image-name
```

The only new thing here, is that the path has been changed to
`/github/workspace/`. This is the home directory of your repository, so to
speak. Now there's the `uses` keyword that's new:

```
uses: actions/checkout@v5
```

This action checkouts your repository inside the VM, so the files in the repo
are available inside the VM. Then, there's this action here:

```
- uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
  with:
    name: my-figures
    path: /github/workspace/fig/
```

This action takes what's inside `/github/workspace/fig/` (which will be the
output of our pipeline) and makes the contents available as so-called
"artifacts". Artifacts are the outputs of your workflow. In our case, as stated,
the output of the pipeline. So let's run this by pushing a change, and let's
take a look at these artifacts!

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <video width="640" height="480" controls>
    <source src="images/ga_2.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>

As you can see from the video above, a zip file is now available and can be
downloaded. This zip contains our plots! It is thus possible to rerun our
workflow in the cloud. This has the advantage that we can now focus on simply
changing the code, and not have to bother with boring manual steps. For example,
let's change this target in the `_targets.R` file:

```
tar_target(
    commune_data,
    clean_unemp(unemp_data,
                place_name_of_interest = c("Luxembourg", "Dippach",
                                           "Wiltz", "Esch/Alzette",
                                           "Mersch", "Dudelange"),
                col_of_interest = active_population)
)

```

I've added "Dudelange" to the list of communes to plot. Let me push this change
to the repo now, and let's take a look at the artifacts. The video below
summarises the process:

<div style="text-align:center;">
  <video width="640" height="480" controls>
    <source src="images/ga_3.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  </video>
</div>

As you can see in the video, the `_targets.R` script was changed, and the
changes pushed to Github. This triggered the action we've defined before. The
plots (artifacts) get refreshed, and we can download them. We see then that
Dudelange was added in the `communes.png` plot!

It is also possible to "deploy" the plots directly to another branch, and do
much, much more. I just wanted to give you a little taste of Github Actions (and
more generally GitOps). The possibilities are virtually limitless, and I still
can't get over the fact that Github Actions is free for public repositories.

## Building a Docker image and pushing it to a registry

It is also possible to build a Docker image and have it made available on an
image registry. You can see how this works on this
[repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/ga_demo). This images can then be
used as a base for other RAPs, as in this
[repository](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/ga_demo_rap/tree/main). Why do this?
Well because of "separation of concerns". You could have a repository which
builds in image containing your development environment: this could be an image
with a specific version of R and R packages built with Nix. And then have as
many repositories as projects that run RAPs using that development environment
image as a basis. Simply add the project-specific packages that you need for
each project.

## Running a pipeline straight from Github Actions

Using Docker on Github Actions has the advantage that you can use the same image
to develop locally on your computer, and then also on CI. However, you could
also run the pipeline straight from a Github Actions runner, but it'll take some
effort to set up the environment on CI. Take a look at [the example from this
repository](https://github.com/rap4all/housing/tree/gitops-pipeline).

The yaml file used in this action (which you can find
[here](https://github.com/rap4all/housing/blob/gitops-pipeline/.github/workflows/targets.yaml))
was generated by running `targets::tar_github_actions()` and was then modified
further, mostly to add the required development libraries to compile the needed
R packages (under the `Install Linux system dependencies` step).

This action takes advantage of the included Github Actions cache to backup the
targets from the pipeline, so they can also get skipped with subsequent runs:

<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tar_github_actions_skip.png")
```
</div>

This can also be achieved with Docker by mounting volumes, but requires more manual setup.

Another difference with Docker is that the outputs are not saved as an artifact, but instead
get pushed to the `targets-runs` branch:

<div style="text-align:center;">
```{r, echo = F}
knitr::include_graphics("images/tar_github_actions_targets-runs.png")
```
</div>

The previous examples assumed you didn't use Nix, but if you did, you can also
run pipelines from inside Nix and with `{rixpress}`. Look at this `yaml` file
from the `rixpress_demos` repository that shows how to run a `{rixpress}`
pipeline on GitHub Actions
[link](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/rixpress_demos/blob/master/.github/workflows/run_r_py_xgboost.yaml).

## GitHub Actions without Nix

If you’re not using Nix, you’ll have to set up GitHub Actions manually. 
Suppose you have a package project and want to run unit tests on each push.
See for example the `{myPackage}`
package, in particular [this
file](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/myPackage/blob/main/.github/workflows/rcmdcheck.yaml).
This action runs on each push and pull request on Windows, Ubuntu and macOS:

```
on:
  push:
    branches: [ "main" ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ "main" ]

jobs:
  rcmdcheck:
    runs-on: ${{ matrix.os }}
    strategy:
      matrix:
        os: [ubuntu-latest, windows-latest, macos-latest]
```

Several steps are executed, all using pre-defined actions from the `r-lib` project:

```
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v4
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2
    - uses: r-lib/actions/setup-r-dependencies@v2
      with:
        extra-packages: any::rcmdcheck
        needs: check
    - uses: r-lib/actions/check-r-package@v2
```

An action such as `r-lib/actions/setup-r@v2` will install R on any of the
supported operating systems without requiring any configuration from you. If you
didn't use such an action, you would need to define three separate actions: one
that would be executed on Windows, on Ubuntu and on macOS. Each of these
operating-specific actions would install R in their operating-specific way.

Check out the workflow results to see how the package could be improved
[here](https://github.com/b-rodrigues/myPackage/actions/runs/12348361696).

Here again, using Nix simplifies this process immensely. Look at this workflow
file from `{rix}`'s repository
[here](https://github.com/ropensci/rix/blob/main/.github/workflows/tests-r-via-nix.yaml).
Setting up the environment is much easier, as is running the actual test suite.
